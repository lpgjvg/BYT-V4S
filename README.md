# Volunteer For Salesforce - LWR Site (Experienced Cloud)

Introducing the New Redesigned Personal Site for Volunteers for Salesforce! ðŸŒŸ

 I'm equally excited and thrilled to share my side project  - a brand-new Personal Site for Salesforce Volunteers, built on Lightning Web Components (LWC) and hosted as a Lightning Web Runtime (LWR) site!   ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
 

ðŸ”— Demo of the site:

ðŸ”¥ What's New:

âœ¨ **Modern Design:** The revamped site looks sleek with modern design, offering a visually appealing interface to engage visitors effortlessly. <br>
âœ¨ **Lightning Performance:** Say goodbye to loading delays! Thanks to LWR, the new site now loads fast, ensuring a smooth browsing experience for every user. <br>
âœ¨ **Interactive Features:** I've added interactive components using LWC that allow volunteers to easily access their dashboards, sign up for events, and access shift calendars with just a few clicks. <br>
âœ¨ **Mobile-Optimized:** The new site is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. <br>
âœ¨ **Recurring Shift Management:** Now volunteers will have the ability to bulk sign up or cancel shifts. They will be able to pick and choose from the list of future shifts. <br>
âœ¨ **Report hours:** Now volunteers will be able to report hours with ease and can pick even the shifts that were completed in the past 30 days (configurable). <br>
âœ¨ **Shift Calendar:** Ability to sign up for any future or past shift (configurable) and the shift colours can be easily managed at the record level. <br><br>

## Issues with deployment

I will keep logging common pre and post deployment issues and workarounds in this section.

1. Site keeps loading the Volunteer Lookup Page though proper contact id is supplied in the URL.

   ```
   The repository comes with Account sharing rule for the site guest user. If Contact object sharing setting is not controlled by parent Account
   then the guest user wont be able to access the contacts.

   The workaround here is to create a sharing rule specific to contact object.

   Please refer to a sample sharing rule below. Define the rule according to your organisation needs.

   ```
